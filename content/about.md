I blog mostly about [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) projects that I've done. Hopefully, others can use some of it. I tend not to think about licenses too much on my projects, but I intend for them to be shared and used by whomever for whatever purpose. Feel free to use whatever you find on this blog in whatever way you'd like as well as my projects on [github](https://github.com/corynissen).

Also, I'm working on documenting and mapping baseball teams and ballparks in America. Check out my map of baseball on the [Baseballmapper website](http://www.baseballmapper.com). Also, on [twitter](https://twitter.com/baseballmapper), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6yYdmQSZqkTZ8UPVdw6AYg), [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/baseballmapper/), [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/189563624@N02/page2) and [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/baseballmapper/) as @baseballmapper. All photos on the @baseballmapper [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/189563624@N02/page2) page are licensed as creative commons public domain, so please use them if you are looking for baseball pictures for your project.
